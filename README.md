This is a project for Hackathon (Coding Lesson)

## WEBSITE CARD MAKER
So I will make Card Maker like Birthday Card, Christmas Card and else.

### MY PROJECT IDEA
My idea to make Card Maker on the Website it's:
1. Sign in with Google / Microsoft
2. Home page + New project button
3. Choose Background Color
4. Insert an image file from computer (Like Birthday Cake, etc)
5. Add a text, choose text color and font style
6. If the Card project has finished, could save the project to computer.
